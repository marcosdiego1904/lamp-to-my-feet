          <h3>üöÄ The Science Behind This Method</h3>
          <p>
            Memory experts and neuroscientists agree: the best way to retain information is to engage multiple cognitive processes.
            This method is based on three scientifically proven learning techniques:
          </p>

          <h4>üß† 1. Active Recall</h4>
          <p>
            Studies show that **retrieving information from memory strengthens neural pathways**.
            Instead of passively reading, this system forces you to recall verses, improving retention.
          </p>

          <h4>üîÅ 2. Spaced Repetition</h4>
          <p>
            The **forgetting curve** (Ebbinghaus, 1885) proves that revisiting information at spaced intervals 
            helps **move knowledge from short-term to long-term memory**.
          </p>

          <h4>üîç 3. Chunking & Progressive Learning</h4>
          <p>
            Research shows that breaking down large amounts of text into **smaller, meaningful chunks** 
            (like splitting a verse into fragments) **improves recall and understanding**.
          </p>

          <p><strong>‚ú® This is why our approach helps you memorize faster and more effectively!</strong></p>
